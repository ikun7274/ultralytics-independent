    Why this exists
    ---------------
    ``BaseDataset._raw_cache`` is a per-worker LRU of ORIGINAL-resolution frames whose capacity is
    ``max(4, slice_raw_cache_size)``. It can only pay off if the sub-samples of one source image are
    visited while that image is still resident. The pool's index layout does cluster them
    (``index // n_per`` in the base segment, contiguous runs in the other segments), but the trainer
    shuffles the pool globally, so with N images a sub-sample's siblings sit ~``6.5 * N`` samples away
    -- the LRU misses on nearly every call and each sub-sample re-decodes its original JPEG (measured
    203 ms for a 4000x3000 frame vs 21 ms for a cached-frame copy).

    Ordering rule
    -------------
    Consumes the "units" produced by :meth:`BaseDataset.grouped_sample_units`: a unit is a group of at
    most four source images, holding each image's pool indices as its own block. Units are visited in
    random order and each unit is consumed ROUND-ROBIN over its blocks, so all of the unit's source
    images stay inside the LRU for the whole unit and each is decoded once instead of once per
    sub-sample.

    Trade-off (deliberate, and why it is a config switch)
    -----------------------------------------------------
    Mosaic draws its 3 partner images from ``dataset.buffer`` -- the most recent ``max_buffer_length``
    samples. Under grouped sampling that window is the current unit rather than several hundred
    unrelated images: every mosaic still stitches four DIFFERENT scenes, but the same four recur
    within a unit, and so does the batch composition. Set ``slice_grouped_sampler=False`` to restore
    upstream Mosaic randomness at the cost of re-decoding each original once per sub-sample.

        boundaries, and ``__len__`` returns it verbatim -- the pool length and the decodable
        index range therefore share one source of truth and can never drift apart.

        The result is cached, but the cache is VERSION-STAMPED on ``tuple(self._segment_lengths())``
        -- its own input -- instead of "first call wins".

        Why that matters: the branch switches are NOT settled by ``__init__``. The normal path is
        ``__init__`` -> ``build_transforms`` -> ``v8_transforms`` attaching ``slice_transform`` /
        ``slice_all_tiles`` / ``*_keep`` onto the object afterwards, and this module already relies
        on that order (``len(self)`` is only logged after ``build_transforms``). A first-call-wins
        cache made that order a silent correctness requirement: anything that touched ``len()``
        earlier -- a partially configured dataset, a test/script that flips a switch after
        constructing one, or a future edit that logs ``len()`` mid-``__init__`` -- froze the
        boundaries on the OLD switches, after which the pool length disagreed with the decodable
        index range and samples were dropped / indexed out of range with no error at all.

        Cost (measured, 5-original all-branches pool): 2.5 us/call vs 0.1 us for the first-call-wins
        accessor and 3.6 us for no cache at all -- i.e. it hands back about two thirds of the L8
        change. That is deliberate and cheap in absolute terms: at 8520 images/epoch the pool is
        ~85k samples, so the stamp costs ~0.2 s CPU per epoch (~0.01% of an epoch that decodes every
        sample at original resolution) and it retires a whole silent-failure class. Keep the stamp
        DERIVED from ``_segment_lengths``; never hand-maintain a second list of switches here -- that
        would move the drift, not remove it.

        (``slice_raw_cache_size``) absorbs repeated decoding of the same image across its

        Returns the image as a contiguous uint8 array with at least 3 dims (H, W, C); grayscale
        is expanded to (H, W, 1).

        Caching: by default a hit returns a COPY, not the cached array. Callers legitimately take
        ownership of the result (e.g. ``_build_ratio_sample`` keeps ``big = im`` when no padding is
        needed, and downstream affine / mosaic transforms write in place), so handing out the cached

        ~10-30x cheaper than decoding a large JPEG.

        ``copy=False`` opts out and may return the shared LRU buffer itself (a full-resolution
        memcpy is ~20 ms on a 4000x3000 frame, so it is worth skipping when it is provably safe).
        The contract: the caller must only READ the returned array -- never write into it, never
        hand it to something that writes. compose uses this, because it only copies its sources
